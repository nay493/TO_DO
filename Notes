Rlogin vs SSH:

Both used to remotely access a computer and run programs and do other things as
if you are actually sitting right in front of it.

Rlogin is not secure

    SSH traffic is encrypted while Rlogin traffic is not
    SSH authenticates the user while Rlogin does not
    SSH can be used for automation while Rlogin cannot ?
    Rlogin is no longer being used in favor of SSH
